//Wednesday: Factorialize!
//Declare a function factorialize(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of the provided integer.

//If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

//Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

//For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
let fact=1;
for(i=1;i<10;i++){
    fact=fact * (i+1);
}console.log(fact);
